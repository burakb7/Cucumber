1-) What is JDBC?
- It stands for Java Data Base Connectivity
- It is a Java library that allows us to get connected
with Database and write our automation codes for database testing.

2-) How do you use JDBC?
- I create a connection to the database by using the credentials(url(hostname), port number, username and password)
then I sent my queries and get the results and compare the result with the values on the UI.
